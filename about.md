# About FolkBär

Our folk orchestra FolkBär (a.k.a. FolkBerlin) is a wonderful opportunity for intercultural connection via music. 

Everyone, who is interested in the music of other cultures, plays an instrument or sings, is welcome to join. 

Our folk orchestra meets regularly for tune-learning sessions and open jam-sessions in parks, bars and maybe soon on stage.

We learn by ear and play mostly acoustic. We welcome all musicians from all kind of regions, with all kind of traditional instruments. 

The events are free of charge.

If you are interested to join our project, please feel free to come to our tune-learning next week and take part!

FolkBär is an amazing possibility to meet musicians from all over the world, learn about other cultures or just enjoy a colorful live.
